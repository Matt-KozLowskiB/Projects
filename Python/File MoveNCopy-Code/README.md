### Python Sample Code: Brains of the GUI
***

The two files in this directory, 'fileModChkandMov' and
'MassFileMove' are the rough coding solutions to the
functions for which the GUI was created in the first
place.   The 'MassFileMove' file, as its name suggests,
contains code that takes all the files in the selected
directory and moves them en masse to a destination folder
that is user selected.  The beauty of the code is that it
moves the files from one folder to another while keeping
all of their attributes untouched...including the modification
date.
On the other hand, the 'fileModChkandMov' file contains
code which selectively copies files from a user selected
folder to a destination folder, based upon a user-selected
parameter of when the file was 'last modified'.  This can
be useful for version control, back-up or tracking purposes.
