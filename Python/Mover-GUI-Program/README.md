### First Python GUI (Graphical User Interface)
***

This is a GUI I programmed to encompass python code
that provides instantaneous functionality for file 
relocation and tracking file modification properties.
It incorporates a simple database to log each instance
a file's modification properties are reviewed for
tracking purposes, useful in development scenarios.
It demonstrates use of multiple python modules
to achieve this purpose, including tkinter, os,
datetime, and shutil.  A multitude of tkinter widgets
were employed in the creation of this GUI, including
basic examples such as Entry, Label, and Button as
well as more complex varieties such as TreeView, Listbox
and Scrollbars.  This GUI employs two listboxes
with synchronized scrolling.
