### Python Sammple Code/Projects
***

Here are a few samples of my early coding in Python.
While some of these were educational projects, the code
is of my own making unless otherwise indicated.
The 'MySorter' file is (as its name suggests) a
sorting algorithm for integers.  It is a bi-directional
variation of the classic 'selection sort' algorithm,
but instead of sorting from one end based upon highest/
lowest values, it sorts both highest and lowest values
simultaneously, working from both ends towards the middle
for increased efficiency.
The 'OfficeStatus' file is Python Code which given
hypothetical geographic office locations, conducts
a check of the current time and automatically determines
whether the various office locations would be open or
closed based upon the current time and outputs the
results to the screen.
