### SQL Library Project Data Files
***

This folder contains the data used in the SQL Library
Project.  The Books, Borrower, Branch, Publisher and
BookLoans1 text files contain the data used to populate
corresponding tables in the SQL Library Project Database
utilizing MicroSoft SQL Server(2012).

The GeneratedFakeAddressData and GeneratedFakeNameData
are CSV files containing randomly generated and fictitious
User Names and Addresses, as this is a hypothetical
project to simulate a real world Library scenario.
The generated fake data was obtained from a free
online random generator resource.
