### SQL Muncipal Library Project
***

This folder represents my solution to 
a SQL coding project/challenge students
of the Tech Academy were presented with
as part of the curriculum.  It required
the creation of a database with a number
of Tables(See 'CreatLib&Tables.sql'),
each used to track different
pieces of information.  Examples included
Tables to track books, User Library Card
Data, User Personal Data, User history,
Book history, Branch Inventory and Branch
Information.  The students had to populate
the database with real or fictional data
such that a reasonable model of an actual
Library was simulated. The Project-Data
folder contains lists of data I created
for use in the project, while the Project-
Results Folder contains SQL code used to 
answer the various 'test questions' the
students were posed once their database
was populated.
