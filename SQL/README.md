### SQL Project & Sample Code
***

This SQL folder is meant to demonstrate
my working knowledge of the SQL language.
The Library Project was a challenge at the
end of my SQL instruction and was designed
in a way that necessitated the implementation
of nearly all of the concepts presented
in the curriculum.  

The basic purpose of the Library Project
was to demonstrate the ability to create
a database containing multiple Tables,
populate these with data, and then query
the database to answer various questions.
