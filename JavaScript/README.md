### JavaScript Code Samples
***

In this folder may be found some
elementary samples of some rather
simple coding in Javascript. There
are two different varieties of current
date/time programs; these do little more
than collect current time data from the
internet, format it appropriately for
user friendliness, and then output
the results to the screen for viewing.
Another Javascript program demonstrates
a pushbutton with a print window function
attached to it.
