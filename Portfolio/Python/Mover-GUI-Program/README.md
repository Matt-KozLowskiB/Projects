### First Python GUI (Graphical User Interface)
***

This is a GUI I programmed to encompass python code
that provides instantaneous functionality for file 
relocation and tracking file modification properties.
It incorporates a simple database to log each instance
a file's modification properties are reviewed for
tracking purposes, useful in development scenarios.
It demonstrates use of multiple python modules
to achieve this purpose.
