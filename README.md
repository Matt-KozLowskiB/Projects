### Portfolio
***

I am an aspiring software developer currently working my way through the last few parts of
the curriculum at the Tech Academy in Portland, Oregon.   The coursework includes studies in popular
and currently relevant programming languages such as SQL, Javascript, Python, and C#.  I have included
some representative work I have done in response to projects and challenges assigned
to me during my studies.  These examples are samples of my own work, drawing upon
what I was taught during my time at the Tech Academy.  Prior to starting a the Tech
Academy in August 2016, I had absolutely no background programming in any language,
much less experience in Software Development.
